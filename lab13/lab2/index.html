					<h2>All about JC Toringan and Dani Dayao!</h2>
					<p>We are JC and Dani! JC is a second year, Dani is a third year. We have absolutely no idea what we're doing. 
					JC is a Film and Digital Media major and Dani double majors in Critical Race & Ethnic Studies and History of Arts 
					& Visual Cultures. JC has no previous programming experience, but Dani took AP computer science in highschool for 
					2 months then gave up. In other words, this partnership is screwed! Other than being bad at programming, JC and 
					Dani are both Filipino-Americans who work together in UCSC's Filipino Student Association. But, most importantly, 
					they are both brats.</p>
