				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function in JavaScript with DOM manipulation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I really did not have many problems with this lab. The biggest issue was being able to have a place to input text for 
					the conversation to work, but a simple google search fixed it! </p>
