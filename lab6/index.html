					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learn to declare arrays and objects.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My biggest problem arose with the syntax at the begginning, as I was using equal signs to declare a variable 
						instead of a colon.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This is the fastest I've ever finished a lab, and I did not start it the day it was due! Thus, I am able to make it
						look nicer and fully understand what I am doing. </p>
