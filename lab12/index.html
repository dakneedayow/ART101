				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Struggled pretty hard with this lab. After class on thursday I was able to figure the main part out, but I could not get
					Task X because I was not able to get the descriptions to show up with the house (unless I actually wrote it in the variable,
					which I assume is not the right way to do it).
