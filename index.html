					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p> My name is Dani Dayao (they/she) and I am a 3rd year at UCSC. I am double majoring in Critical Race & Ethnic 
						Studies and History of Art & Visual Cultures, with a concentration in Curation, Heritage, and Museums. That's 
						a lot of words to basically say I have very little experience in the programming department. Honestly, I am just
						taking this class for my MF GE, but hopefully I can pass and learn some cool & fun things along the way! Outside of 
						my academics, I spend most of my time student organizing for the Filipino Student Association on campus known as 
						Bayanihan. I would say I am definitely more of a people person than a computer person :P But when I am not doing that,
						I am most likely at home cooking, reading, gaming, and crocheting!
